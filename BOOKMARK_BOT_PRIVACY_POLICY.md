# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the `Bookmark Bot#5726` bot, which has access to all channels in the [Astro Discord Server](https://astro.build/chat). Your being a member of the Astro Discord Server indicates that you agree with this Privacy Policy.
A user with the Support Squad, Maintainer, or Core role (a "privileged user") can trigger the bot to read and store a message by reacting to it using a "trigger emoji". The two trigger emojis are ðŸ’Œ or ðŸ’¡. 

## What we collect

When a privileged user reacts to a message using a trigger emoji, we access only that message. Then we store:

-   A link to that message on Discord, of the format https://discord.com/channels/830184174198718474/CHANNEL_ID/MESSAGE_ID
-   The contents of the message
-   The trigger emojis that reacted to the message

## Where we store it

We store this information in a Notion database. This database is publically available and shared with Core, Maintainer, and Support Squad users.

## Data retention

If all trigger emojis are removed from a message, or if the message is deleted, the data is removed from the Notion database. Note that once removed, the data is still available in the Notion database's history, which is accessible only to [Astro Core members](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#level-3-l3---core).

## Where information is processed

The bot is hosted on [Autocode](https://autocode.com)'s servers and uses the Discord API and the Notion API to access and store the data.

## Changes to this privacy policy

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time, with at least 24 hours prior notice in the [Astro Discord server](https://astro.build/chat). Your being a member in the server after the changes have been applied indicates that you agree with the revised privacy policy.

Feel free to contact us at [dan@astro.build](mailto:dan@astro.build) if you have any questions about this privacy policy.
